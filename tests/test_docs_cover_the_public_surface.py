"""The user-facing docs must name every knob the public surface actually has.

The code-to-code seams are already guarded: `test_api.py` compares
`InvisibleOptions` against the engine signature field by field, and
`test_cli.py` drives the commands. Nothing guarded the code-to-DOCS seam, and it
drifted exactly the way an unguarded seam does -- silently, one addition at a
time. When this was first measured, `docs/cli.md` named none of
`--adaptive-polish`, `--controlnet-scale`, `--detect/--no-detect`, `--humanize`,
`--strength`, `--tile-size`, `--tile-overlap` or `--unsharp`, and
`docs/python-api.md` named 9 of the 16 `InvisibleOptions` fields.

These tests read the real Click tree and the real dataclass rather than a
hand-kept list, so a knob added tomorrow fails here until someone documents it.
Both accept EITHER spelling of a boolean pair: `--keep-metadata` documents
`--strip-metadata/--keep-metadata` perfectly well, and requiring the on-form
would force noise into the guides.
