"""Doubao visible watermark detector/localizer.

Doubao (ByteDance) stamps every generated image with a visible "豆包AI生成"
(Doubao AI generated) text strip in the bottom-right corner -- the explicit AIGC
label mandated by China's TC260 standard, a near-white semi-transparent overlay.

Detection matches the bundled glyph silhouette against the corner candidate; removal
is the shared **localize -> fill**. Doubao reuses that aligned silhouette as a sparse
glyph footprint instead of bounding the thresholded corner response: bright scene
texture behind this bottom-edge mark can otherwise expand a solid mask to the frame
edges, where classical inpainting has no outside context. This module shares
:class:`remove_ai_watermarks._text_mark_engine.TextMarkEngine` and
supplies only Doubao's tuned :class:`TextMarkConfig` (bottom-right corner,
``assets/doubao_alpha.png`` -- the detection silhouette, rebuilt by
``scripts/visible_alpha_solve.py``). Arbitrary-region inpainting still lives in
``region_eraser`` / the ``erase`` command.
